## Hello World!

###### Two simple words, an infinite number of opportunities...

  As web developers, we have all used this phrase. It's a starting point, an insurance that we can *communicate*, that we have a basic handle on a particular language, framework or library.

  But it's more than just that. It's an introduction, a call to action and it's a reminder of why we code: to connect people around the globe. To share our stories, ideas, and values.
